# LinkedIn Gamified Onboarding & Coffee Chat Scheduler

## 🚀 Overview

This project reimagines LinkedIn’s social experience for college students and new users. Our goal is to empower new users to explore and adopt LinkedIn features through a **gamified onboarding experience**, while fostering meaningful professional relationships via a **built-in Coffee Chat Scheduler** integrated with calendar tools.

By turning discovery into a game and enabling seamless in-app networking, we help LinkedIn become not just a profile builder, but a platform for personal growth and career momentum.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

LinkedIn offers powerful tools—posting, joining groups, following industry leaders, connecting with professionals—but college students are often unaware of these features.

> **Pain Point:** Many students sign up for LinkedIn but stop at creating a profile. They don’t know what to do next, and LinkedIn doesn’t actively guide them.

> **Result:** Dormant accounts, missed opportunities, and impersonal networking.

## 💡 Our Solution

We designed a **two-pronged feature upgrade** that addresses discoverability and engagement:

### 1. 🌟 Gamified Onboarding System
- Users earn points by exploring underused features (e.g., creating a post, following hashtags, joining a group, leaving a comment).
- Milestones unlock **2 weeks of free LinkedIn Premium**—an immediate value boost.
- Points system encourages consistent usage with **daily missions**, **badges**, and **progress banners** to display on profiles.

### 2. ☕ Coffee Chat Scheduler (powered by AI)
- Premium users unlock a **built-in calendar integration** (via Calendly API) to schedule Zoom-like chats *without leaving LinkedIn*.
- AI suggests ideal times by cross-referencing mutual availability.
- Users build **coffee chat streaks**—encouraging ongoing dialogue and real relationships.
- Streak points unlock profile banners and social rewards.
